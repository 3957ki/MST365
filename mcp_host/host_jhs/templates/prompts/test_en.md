# CSS Selector Fix Request

The following CSS selectors failed during website testing:

```json
{{ failedSelectors }}
```

Here is the HTML context if available:
```html
{{ html }}
```

Please analyze and suggest improved CSS selectors that are more likely to work. Consider:
1. Syntax errors in the original selectors
2. More robust selector strategies (e.g., using multiple attributes, classes, or text content)
3. Alternative approaches if the same element needs to be selected

Return your suggestions as JSON in the following format:
```json
{
  "original_selector1": "improved_selector1",
  "original_selector2": "improved_selector2"
  // etc.
}
```

Also include a brief explanation of each fix.
